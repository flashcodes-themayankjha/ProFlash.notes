# ProFlash

This is a React Native application built with Expo and Supabase.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and the Expo CLI installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashcodes-themayankjha/ProFlash.notes.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the Expo developer tools in your browser. You can then run the app on a physical device or in a simulator.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run android`: Runs the app on a connected Android device or emulator.
- `npm run ios`: Runs the app on an iOS simulator.
- `npm run web`: Runs the app in a web browser.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
